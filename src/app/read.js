🔹 What is <aside>?

<aside> is a semantic HTML tag used for:

Content that is related to the main content but not the main focus

🔸 Simple Meaning (Easy words)

🧠 Think of <aside> as:

“Extra information shown beside the main content”

Just like:

      A newspaper’s side column
      YouTube’s recommended videos
      Medium’s “Most Popular” section


Cheat Sheet: The "Short Note" to Remember
If you want to center something perfectly in the middle of a container, copy this mental checklist:

The Holy Trinity of Centering:

flex: "Turn on" the flexbox engine.

justify-center: Center it horizontally (Left/Right).

items-center: Center it vertically (Top/Bottom).

🔹 When should YOU use flex-1?

✅ Side-by-side layouts
✅ Image + text columns
✅ Equal-width cards
✅ Responsive sections

🧠 Easy Memory Trick

flex-1 = “share the space equally”
